## Advanced

soooo if you really want you can edit pretty much every constant in the mod with a json, syntax is just
```json
{
    "number-constant": {
        "value": 1
    },
    "color-constant": {
        "value": [0, 0.5, 1, 1]
    }
}
```
im not writing out every constant name if ur json editing you can go into the source and check the map in src->utils->constants.hpp

## Trigger Indicators v2

so originally there was a rant here but uhhhh thats *sooooo* last beta, instead, uhhh, give me feature requests now that this mod is for all things drawing trigger info things related instead of just trigger indicators, :3
