## Trigger Indicators v2
*little rant uwu*

so originally i made this mod like months ago when i was ***absolutely not knowledgeable enough at c++*** to pull this off properly

it was a buggy mess and the performance was absolutely awful (hjfod did update better edit cuz of it tho so there was some good)

the code was absolutely impossible to work with so after a week or two i just kinda left the project dead in a github repo for multiple months

ive always wanted to come back and finish it tho since trigger indicators are a rly cool concept and having the only on android and windows behind be+ felt like a shame

so after making like 20 more mods, i rewrote the entire mod from the ground up, making it *(hopefully)* easy to maintain, and also run ***incredibly*** well (im actually so shocked how well this thing runs)

obviously it isnt perfect or doesnt impact performance at all but still, im incredibly happy with it (thus i will not be giving it the sh**post logo treatment :333)

ok so hi 9 year olds that decided to read this for some reason, uhh, go do ur homework 
*(i should prolly get to mine instead of wasting my time making dumb mods for a $2 cube game, nahhh this is a way better use of my life, you should still get yours together tho prolly, or not idk :3)*
