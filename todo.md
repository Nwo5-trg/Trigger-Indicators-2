# To-do uwu :333 rawr im not doing any of ts

## prolly doing

- setting to not cull when an object with groups is selected

- target item id in a item edit trigger taken as group target

- ~~show groupids on lines~~ (beta.6)

- more group label customization

- item ids

- use member vars from spawn indicators

## maybe

- 90 degree lines

- control ids

- show named groups on lines

- animation ids

## lil less maybe but still maybe

- dynamic indicator thickness with editor zoom

- dynamic input/output sides

## never doing ts

- spawn remapping support

- draw lines from a gradient trigger to its vertexes

- more optimizations

- material ids

- displaying the comparison that item count and item comp triggers are actually doing on the trigger (never doing ts but like not a joke this time)
